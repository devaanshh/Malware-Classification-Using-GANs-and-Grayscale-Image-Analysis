# Malware-Classification-Using-GANs-and-Grayscale-Image-Analysis
As malware becomes more sophisticated, traditional detection techniques struggle to keep up. This project aims to strengthen malware classification by combining advanced machine learning techniques, such as grayscale image analysis of malware binaries, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By converting malware binaries into grayscale images, we explore new ways to classify and detect evolving malware strains.
With the increasing complexity of modern malware, existing detection methods are becoming less effective. This project seeks to address this issue by utilizing malware visualization as grayscale images to improve classification. Additionally, we introduce GANs to generate synthetic malware images, augmenting the dataset and enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the classification model. The ultimate goal is to develop a more reliable tool for detecting and classifying various types of malware.
