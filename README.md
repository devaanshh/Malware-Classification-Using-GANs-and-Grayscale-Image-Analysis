# Malware-Classification-Using-Grayscale-Image-Analysis-and GAN-Driven-Deep-Learning 

## Introduction

As malware becomes more sophisticated, traditional detection techniques struggle to keep up. This project aims to strengthen malware classification by combining advanced machine learning techniques, such as grayscale image analysis of malware binaries, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By converting malware binaries into grayscale images, we explore new ways to classify and detect evolving malware strains.
With the increasing complexity of modern malware, existing detection methods are becoming less effective. This project seeks to address this issue by utilizing malware visualization as grayscale images to improve classification. Additionally, we introduce GANs to generate synthetic malware images, augmenting the dataset and enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the classification model. The ultimate goal is to develop a more reliable tool for detecting and classifying various types of malware.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Cybersecurity is facing serious challenges due to the increasing spread of malware. Improving detection and response tactics requires malware categorisation, which entails grouping malicious software into discrete families. However, because malware samples are so diverse and complicated, traditional methods of classifying malware frequently have drawbacks. Unbalanced datasets can also make classification performance worse, especially for malware families that are under-represented.

Our goal in this research is to use image-based representations of malware binaries to create a reliable and effective malware classification system. Deep learning algorithms are employed to classify the greyscale or RGB images resulting from the visualisation of malware binaries. The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for multiclass classification, including XceptionNet, EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, VGG16, DenseNet, and Inception ResNet V2 of malware families.

## Objective of our project 
- Develop a machine learning model for multi-class malware classification using grayscale image visualization of malware binaries. 
- Integrate Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic malware images and augment the training dataset. 
- Improve the accuracy and robustness of the classification model through the combined use of GANs and image-based analysis techniques. 
- Create a reliable tool for effectively detecting and classifying several types of malwares. 
- Contribute to the enhancement of digital security by addressing the evolving threats posed by sophisticated malware.
